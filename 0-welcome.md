# Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial in Python. Here are the data structures that I will cover in my tutorial:

- [Queues](1-queue.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-list.md)
- [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each section will contain an explanation of the data structure, main purpose, best practices, example, and an exercise challenge to test your understanding. A solution will be provided even though I strongly encourage you to look at only after you have attempted the exercise on your own.
